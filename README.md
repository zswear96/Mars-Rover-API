## How It's Made:

**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

In this project, I utilized an API from NASA that pulls back photos that were taken by the Mars Rover. The user can select a date and my API will pull back the photo that the Mars Rover took the date they selected. 

## Lessons Learned:

I learned how to use API's to pull back complex data and then use that data to display it to the user.
